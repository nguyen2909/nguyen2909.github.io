<h2>Amdahl Corporation introduces the Amdahl 470</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1970.amdahl470.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:300px;"><strong>Gene Amdahl, father of the IBM System/360, starts his own company, Amdahl Corporation, to compete with IBM in mainframe computer systems. The 470V/6 was the company’s first product and ran the same software as IBM System/370 computers but cost less and was smaller and faster.</strong></p>
<h2>Europe And The First Mass-Market"Webs"</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_networking.web_1972_firstweb.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:300px;"><strong>By1971 Sam Fedida at the British Post Office and teams at the BBC and the IBA (Independent Broadcasting Association) have started developing Web-like information systems that use televisions for display. The two latter systems, based on work by Philips, broadcast data on an unused portion of the TV signal. They evolve into the Teletext information services found on most European TVs into the 2000s. Sam Fedida's videotex standard at the Post Office (which also runs the telephone system) uses phone lines, and has high ambitions for broad-reaching uses like today’s Web. It becomes the foundation of England’s Prestel and, later, France’s wildly successful Minitel.</strong></p>
<h2>SuperPaint is completed</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_graphics.games_1972.Superpaint.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:300px;"><strong>SuperPaint is probably the first digital computer drawing system to use a frame buffer—a special high-speed memory—and the ancestor of all modern paint programs. It could create sophisticated animations, in up to 16.7 million colors, had adjustable paintbrushes, video magnification, and used a graphics tablet for drawing. It was designed by Richard Shoup and others at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). Its designers won a technical Academy Award in 1998 for their invention.</strong></p>
<h2>Wang Laboratories releases the Wang 2200</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1973.wang2200.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:300px;"><strong>Wang was a successful calculator manufacturer, then a successful word processor company. The 1973 Wang 2200 makes it a successful computer company, too. Wang sold the 2200 primarily through Value Added Resellers, who added special software to solve specific customer problems. The 2200 used a built-in CRT, cassette tape for storage, and ran the programming language BASIC. The PC era ended Wang’s success, and it filed for bankruptcy in 1992.</strong></p>
<h2>MITS Altair 8800 kit appears in Popular Electronics</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://myvigour.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/cloud-computing-images.jpg')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1975.mitsaltair.jpg" style="float:left;width:200px;height:300px;"><strong>For its January issue, hobbyist magazine Popular Electronics runs a cover story of a new computer kit – the Altair 8800. Within weeks of its appearance, customers inundated its maker, MITS, with orders. Bill Gates and Paul Allen licensed their BASIC programming language interpreter to MITS as the main language for the Altair. MITS co-founder Ed Roberts invented the Altair 8800 — which sold for $297, or $395 with a case — and coined the term “personal computer”. The machine came with 256 bytes of memory (expandable to 64 KB) and an open 100-line bus structure that evolved into the “S-100” standard widely used in hobbyist and personal computers of this era. In 1977, MITS was sold to Pertec, which continued producing Altairs in 1978.</strong></p>
