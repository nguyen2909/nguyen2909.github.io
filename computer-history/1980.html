<h2>Apple 1984 Commercial Debuts</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/vt100_had.jpg?w=800&h=600')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://hackadaycom.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/vt100_had.jpg?w=800&h=600')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_popularculture_1984.mac1984.jpg" style="float:left;width:300px;height:300px;"><strong>Apple’s “1984” commercial is aired during Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984. Earlier that month, Apple's Macintosh computer was already the most anticipated personal computer release ever. As a part of the rollout, Apple commissioned director Ridley Scott to direct a one-minute commercial for the Mac. The commercial, which cost at least three hundred thousand dollars, was based partly on George Orwell's novel 1984, with the role of Big Brother being filled by a man dictating to the masses from a giant screen, only to have a hammer-wielding woman run up and destroy the screen, freeing the people. The “Big Brother” motif was a veiled reference to IBM, Apple’s main competitor. The commercial, shown only once, is considered a major turning point in the marketing of computers.</storng></p>

<h2>Apollo Computer unveils its first workstation, its DN100</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f4075addb60c3092e4de37a1f5e09792')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-f4075addb60c3092e4de37a1f5e09792')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1981.apollodn100.jpg" style="float:left;width:300px;height:300px;"><strong>The DN100 is based on the Motorola 68000 microprocessor, high-resolution display and built-in networking - the three basic features of all workstations. Apollo and its main competitor, Sun Microsystems, optimized their machines to run the computer-intensive graphics programs common in engineering and scientific applications. Apollo was a leading innovator in the workstation field for more than a decade, and was acquired by Hewlett-Packard in 1989.</strong></p>

<h2>Franklin releases Apple II “clones”</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQht_noM9nq6uGcpmCh_VPt0AFv9PXq9cjH-FmiNBW3Ny_AS8eP')">
<img style="background-image:url('https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQht_noM9nq6uGcpmCh_VPt0AFv9PXq9cjH-FmiNBW3Ny_AS8eP')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1982.franklinace100.jpg" style="float:left;width:300px;height:300px;"><strong>Created almost five years after the original Apple II, Franklin's Ace 1000 main logic board is nearly identical to that in the Apple II+ computer, and other models were later cloned as well. Franklin was able to undercut Apple's pricing even while offering some features not available on the original. Initially, Franklin won a court victory allowing them to continue cloning the machines, but in 1988, Apple won a copyright lawsuit against Franklin, forcing them to stop making Apple II “clones.”</strong></p>

<h2>Apple Introduces Lisa Computer</h2>
<p style="background-image:url('http://lowendmac.com/wp-content/uploads/apple-lisa-big.png')">
<img style="background-image:url('http://lowendmac.com/wp-content/uploads/apple-lisa-big.png')" src="http://images.computerhistory.org/timeline/timeline_computers_1983.lisa.jpg" style="float:left;width:300px;height:300px;"><strong>Lisa is the first commercial personal computer with a graphical user interface (GUI). It was thus an important milestone in computing as soon Microsoft Windows and the Apple Macintosh would soon adopt the GUI as their user interface, making it the new paradigm for personal computing. The Lisa ran on a Motorola 68000 microprocessor and came equipped with 1 MB of RAM, a 12-inch black-and-white monitor, dual 5.25-inch floppy disk drives and a 5 MB “Profile” hard drive. Lisa itself, and especially its GUI, were inspired by earlier work at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.</strong></p>
