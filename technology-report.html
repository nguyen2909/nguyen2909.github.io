<h2>Taking a photo using Instagram</h2>
<p>You can take a photo from within the app or use an image already stored on your phone or tablet.</p>

<p>To get started, tap the '+' icon along the bottom, where you will be given three choices:<p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 102);font-weight:bold">Gallery</span> to select an existing photo or video already on your device
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 102);font-weight:bold">Photo</span> to take a photo using the camera on your device
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 102);font-weight:bold">Video</span> to shoot a video using the camera on your device
</ul>
<p>Select Photo and you will see a circular arrow icon to the left of the screen which lets you switch to the front camera for selfies.<p>

<h2>Instagram Video</h2>
<p>Instagram recently introduced Instagram Stories, which lets you share photos and videos as a slideshow. Like Snapchat Stories, these disappear <em>after 24 hours</em> and don’t appear on your profile.</p>

<p>You might have noticed circles containing Stories from people you follow at the top of your Instagram feed. Just tap them to view.</p>

<p>To make a Story tap the 'Your Story +’ icon at the top right. Swipe down to add a photo or video from the last 24 hours, or tap the photo button to take a photo or video. You can also write and draw on the picture.</p>
