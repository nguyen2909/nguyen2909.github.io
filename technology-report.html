<h2>Taking a photo using Instagram</h2>
<img src="https://blog.eurail.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Instagram-Hand-taking-a-picture-of-a-beautiful-beach-view-in-Nice-France.jpg"img>
<p>You can take a photo from within the app or use an image already stored on your phone or tablet.</p>

<p>To get started, tap the '+' icon along the bottom, where you will be given three choices:<p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 102);font-weight:bold">Gallery</span> to select an existing photo or video already on your device
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 102);font-weight:bold">Photo</span> to take a photo using the camera on your device
<li><span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 102);font-weight:bold">Video</span> to shoot a video using the camera on your device
</ul>
<p>Select Photo and you will see a circular arrow icon to the left of the screen which lets you switch to the front camera for selfies.<p>

<h2>Editing a photo using Instagram</h2>

<p>Instagram has a range of editing features to improve your photographs or add some special effects.</P>

<h2>Instagram Video</h2>
<img src="https://blog.bufferapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Instagram-stories.png"/img>
<p>Instagram recently introduced Instagram Stories, which lets you share photos and videos as a slideshow. Like Snapchat Stories, these disappear <em>after 24 hours</em> and don’t appear on your profile.</p>

<p>You might have noticed circles containing Stories from people you follow at the top of your Instagram feed. Just tap them to view.</p>

<p>To make a Story tap the 'Your Story +’ icon at the top right. Swipe down to add a photo or video from the last 24 hours, or tap the photo button to take a photo or video. You can also write and draw on the picture.</p>

<h2>Clicks to website</h2>
<p>Clicks to website pushes your audience to relevant pages of your website. This is effective in increasing the chances of people engaging with your website.</p>

<h2>App Installs</h2>
<p>App installs encourages your audience to install the app provided.</p>
</hr>

<h2>Video Views</h2>

<p>Video views encourages your audience to watch your sponsored video by displaying in prominent positions on your Instagram feed. Video has proven to be highly engaging and therefore a popular type of advertising.</p>

<p>I believe Instagram will be successful for few reasons:
<ul>
<li>People increasingly less focused on long text and video</li>
<li>We can share our images on instagram feed instead of posting each one</li>
<li>Decreasing strangers who want to see our profile if we don't accept their request to follow us</li>
</ul>
