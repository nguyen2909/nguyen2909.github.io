   <h2>MOYES "EMBARRASSED" IN WALES, UPDATES SCARY REID INJURY</h2>
   <p>David Moyes is bitterly disappointed in his players as West Ham United dipped closer to the relegation zone with a 4-1 hammering in Wales.

[ RECAP: Swans 4-1 West Ham ]

Swansea scored early and often, and the Irons could only manage a Michail Antonio consolation marker in the 78th minute.

The loss has the Irons just three points above the drop zone, and Moyes doesn’t need X’s and O’s or a tactics board to break down the loss, taking the blame for his players’ poor performance.
    <p><em><strong>"We played so bad. I couldn’t assess it, it was that poor.The fans travelled through the snow to get here and we let them down badly. That was the poorest performance since I came here. I’m embarrassed.”</em></strong></p>
    <p>There’s reason to be concerned, as West Ham’s run-in is dastardly: Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City are all on the docket, and Leicester, Everton, and Burnley aren’t walkovers. Southampton and Stoke City at home are must-win for Moyes’ men.

West Ham also had a scary injury to Winston Reid, in which the New Zealand defender was stretchered off with his neck in a brace after his knee bent in grotesque fashion.

Moyes admitted the knee is a bigger concern than the head, which is good considering the player was knocked unconscious.</p>
   <p><em><strong>“Winston Reid is conscious, he was knocked out, we are more worried about the injury to his knee than the knock to his head. He’s an important player for us so we hope it’s not too bad.”</em></strong></p>
   <h2>MAAME BINEY TAKES GOLD AT WORLD JUNIOR SHORT TRACK CHAMPIONSHIPS</H2>
   <P>Maame Biney, the bubbly 17-year-old on the U.S. Olympic short track team, won the world junior title in the 500m, her best event, in Poland on Saturday.</P>

   <P>Biney crossed in 44.305 seconds, edging a Hungarian by .054.

She became <em><strong>the first American</strong></em> to win a world junior title since three-time Olympic medalist J.R. Celski in 2009.</P>

   <P>Biney took bronze in the 500m at last year’s junior worlds. She also impressively advanced to the 500m quarterfinals in PyeongChang ahead of a South Korean veteran.</p>

   <P>Born in Ghana, Biney moved to the U.S. at age 5 and was raised in Reston, Va., by a single father, Kweku, who previously immigrated to the U.S.</P>

   <P>But Canada, chasing a fifth consecutive Olympic gold, turned it around in the second period drawing level through Haley Irwin before Marie-Philip Poulin fired them ahead.</P>
   <p>Monique Lamoureux-Morando levelled it up at 2-2 in the third period for the USA and the final went to 15 minutes of sudden death overtime where the teams could not be separated.</p>

   <p>It was 2-2 after five penalty shots each, extending the drama to sudden death. The USA's Jocelyne Lamoureux-Davidson converted her effort and Meghan Agosta could not beat USA keeper Maddie Rooney, sparking wild American celebrations.</p>
   <p>Canada had won the previous four Olympic gold medals, with their 2002, 2010 and 2014 final victories coming against the US.</p>
