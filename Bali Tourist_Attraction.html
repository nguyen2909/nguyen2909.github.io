   <h2>Pura Ulun Danu Bratan</h2>
   <p>The Ulun Danu Beratan Temple is both a famous picturesque landmark and a significant temple complex located on the western side of the Beratan Lake in Bedugul, central Bali. Straddling two islets in the Bratan crater lake and seeming to float on water, Pura Ulun Danu Bratan represents quintessential Bali, with its meru roofs reflecting in the water against a backdrop of misty mountains. This little temple is dedicated to the water goddess Dewi Danu, and people come from villages all over the region to pray for successful irrigation.
All irrigation systems draw water from Lake Batur in Bali’s famed Subak Landscape. The water system is <em>a recognized UNESCO World Cultural Heritage</em>, comprises the technical aspects of rice cultivation and irrigation in Bali. Bali is primarily known for its gorgeous locations, and <strong>Pura Ulun Danu Bratan</strong> is one gem of its vast natural treasures.</p>

   <h2>Dolphin sightings at Lovina</h2>
   <p>Dolphin watching tours at Lovina Beach remain one of the main nature attractions of this quiet and laidback coastal town in North Bali. What this black sand beach lacks in features when compared to the beaches around the island’s south, it makes up for with its frequent sightings of dolphin pods that favour these calm waters. Back in the days, every sunrise, local fishermen in traditional outriggers set out for their daily catches in the bay, and so did the dolphins.You can glimpse several different species of dolphins, but most frequent are the dark-skinned spinner dolphin (Stenella longirostris) which visit Lovina’s bay all year round.<strong>As you come into Lovina you’re pulled through the salty, foggy mist and into a sleepy beachside town that takes you right back to the family beach holiday memories from the 80s.</strong>
